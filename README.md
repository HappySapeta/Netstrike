## CMP425/501 Assessment Project Template.

This is an template project that renders an empty SFML window.
Use this as a starting point of your final assessment. There are two build configurations -- client and server. You can include/exclude source files for each configuration, if you need to build different versions of your game.

**Update this readme file with your name and student number and any relevant instructions for building and running your game.**
